# HeadTracker
A Headtracker for use with the Arduino Nano 33 BLE

Currently not functional. This is a work in progress. Feel free to contact us and help out.

## Whats needed
1) Arduino Nano 33 BLE (or Sense) - Digikey/Newark many others..
3) Soldering Iron
5) 3.5mm mono audio cable. I got a right angle one
6) Small Push Button Switch, for resetting zero

## To Do
~~* Choose a fusion algorithm~~
~~* Add calibration to the GUI~~
* Test PPM output library
** PPM has a lot of gitter due to interrupt timing.. trying to find a solution.
~~* Save config to flash~~
* FRsky trainer connection
* HM10 Wireless remote PPM Board?
