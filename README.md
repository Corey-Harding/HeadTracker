# Reason why Forked - To connect to ysoldak headtracker  
(https://github.com/Corey-Harding/HeadTracker/releases/tag/v2.3xiao)  
These are the compiled binaries from the branch "Xiao nrf52840" and is ~ v2.3pre  
I am leaving this here because it was the only branch that I was able to get to connect to the ysoldak headtracker.  

# RC HeadTracker
If you're an RC enthusiast with a FPV headset, at some point you might have thought wouldn't it be cool if you could turn your head and the camera would follow. That is the intention of this project.
