# RC HeadTracker
If your an RC enthusiast like myself with a FPV headset at some point you thought wouldn't it be cool if I could turn my head and the camera would follow. That is the intention of this project. It is a continuation of the work started by Dennis Frie, Mark Mansur and others in an effort to make it a more simple project.
