## RC HeadTracker
If your an RC enthusiast like myself with a FPV headset at some point you thought wouldn't it be cool if I could turn my head and the camera would follow. That is the intention of this project. It is a continuation of the work started by Dennis Frie, Mark Mansur and others.

Please visit the WIKI https://github.com/dlktdr/HeadTracker/wiki for the hardware required how to build.
