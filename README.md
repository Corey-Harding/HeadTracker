# HeadTracker
Re-work of Dennis Frie's  work for use with a BNO055 Sensor

I've modified the code for the head tracker and started working on a new GUi for it. Based on the BNO055 sensor.

I was going to make the GUI compatible with the old firmware too but It's currently broken for that. I will work on it later if there is any requests to do so.
