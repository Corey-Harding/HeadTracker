# Radio Connection

To get the data from this tracker up to your plane/drone camera mount a trainer connection is used. Most radios support a trainer connection in one form or another. This project supports three trainer methods.

## 1\) [Bluetooth](bluetooth/)

On FRSky Radios with built in Bluetooth you can directly connect. Both the new PARA system and the older Bluetooth will work.  
  
You can also solder in a FRSky Bluetooth module into some radios such as the Radio Master TX16S.

## 2\) [Serial BUS \(SBUS\)](serial-bus-sbus.md)

SBUS is a serial interface, is very fast. If your radio supports SBUS trainer, choose this over method over PPM

## 3\) [Pulse Position Modulation \(PPM\)](pulse-position-modulation-ppm.md)

This is the most common trainer connection. Every radio that supports a trainer connection will most likely support PPM.
